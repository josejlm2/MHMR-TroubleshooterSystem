Feature: Create Location
As an IT staff member
So that the facility members can view and submit tickets to it
I want to add a location to the "Facility Troubleshooter" Database's location list

Scenario: Create new Location
  When I am on the locations page
  When I follow "Create location"
  And I fill in "Name" with "Texas"
  And I press "Save Changes" 
  Then I should see "Texas"
